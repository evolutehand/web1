  <h2>Vinnie Colaiuta</h2>
  <strong>Percussioner <u>International</u> ~ Vol. 1</strong> - No. 4, 1987
  <p>"I think the only thing worse than the music business is stand-up comedy.<br>
  It is tough to maintain any kind of job. You could be hip today and tomorrow you are nothing.<br>
  It is so transitory and trendy you just never know. This puts extra pressure on you because it's like a do or die situation<br>
  I can't really complain though. I bought myself a house and financially, I'm looking pretty good."</p>
