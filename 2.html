  <strong>Who is <u>Steve Gadd</u></strong>
  <p>One of the most influential
drummers of all time, <a href="https://www.drstevegadd.com/"target="_blank" title="Steve Gadd Official Home">Steve Gadd</a>
set a new standard in contemporary
drumming techniques and
performance, and in doing so
launched a thousand imitators.
<br>
Recording so many legendary
drum tracks like; " Aja"," Fifty
Ways to Leave Your Lover"
and "Nite Sprite", there is no
drummer alive today who in
<br>
some way has not been effected
by Steve Gadd. His influence is still
very much felt and can be heard
in the playing of everyone from
Vinnie Colaiuta to Carter Beauford.
And still to this day there is no
one who can get "inside" a tune
and find the "pocket" quite
like the great
Steve Gadd.
